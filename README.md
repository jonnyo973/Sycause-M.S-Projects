# Sycause-M.S-Projects
This will be all my code and presentation from my M.S in Applied Data Science program @ Syracuse University
This is being used as storage for all the projects I have completed in my Masters program at Syracuse. 
I have done 1 project in SQL1 project in python with 2 more to come by the end of June and many in R with 1 more on its way in June. 
I hope this can display a bit of my talents and can be used as a benchmark for myself in my data science journey because this is just the beginning.
